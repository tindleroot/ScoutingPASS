# Scouting P.A.S.S. Google Sheets <BETA>

## Now supporting data storage in Google Sheets!

<div id="description"></div>

## Description:
Scouting PASS implements the Google Sheets integration like any other database.

Set the 'dataFormat' to 'tsv' in your configuration file.   It is set to that by default.

The data will now be sent through the QR code as tab-delimited data.

To pull the data into your Google Spreadsheet, put your cursor in the first cell where you want the data.  When you scan
the QR code it will fill in each cell using the tabs to move to the next cells.

NOTE: Special scripts and setup are no longer needed to use ScoutingPASS with Google Sheets
